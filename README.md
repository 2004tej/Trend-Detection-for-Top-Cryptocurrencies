Problem Statement:
“Detect trends in the top cryptocurrencies (uptrend, downtrend, or consolidation) using historical price data and machine learning techniques.”
Approach:
1.	Data Collection: Use the Kaggle dataset (or an API like CoinGecko) to gather historical price data of the top 10 cryptocurrencies.
2.	Feature Engineering: Calculate key indicators like Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
3.	Trend Labeling: Define a rule-based approach or use clustering to label trends as Uptrend, Downtrend, or Sideways.
4.	Model Selection: Train an ML model (Decision Tree, Random Forest, or LSTM for deep learning) to classify the trend.
5.	Evaluation & Interpretation: Assess the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and visualize trend predictions over time.
6.	Deployment (Optional): Create a simple visualization dashboard to show trends dynamically.
Tools & Technologies:
•	Python (for implementation)
•	Pandas, NumPy (for data processing)
•	Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
•	Scikit-learn (for ML model)
•	TensorFlow/Keras (optional) (for deep learning with LSTM)
